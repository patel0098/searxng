# About IndiCOM

IndiCOM is a [metasearch engine], aggregating the results of other
{{link('search engines', 'preferences')}} while not storing information about
its users.




## Why use it?

- IndiCOM may not offer you as personalized results as Google, but it doesn't
  generate a profile about you.
- IndiCOM doesn't care about what you search for, never shares anything with a
  third-party, and it can't be used to compromise you.

If you do care about privacy, want to be a conscious user, or otherwise believe
in digital freedom, make IndiCOM your default search engine.


## How do I set it as the default search engine?

IndiCOM supports [OpenSearch].  For more information on changing your default
search engine, see your browser's documentation:

- [Firefox]
- [Microsoft Edge] - Behind the link, you will also find some useful instructions
  for Chrome and Safari.
- [Chromium]-based browsers only add websites that the user navigates to without
  a path.


## How does it work?

- IndiCOM is a [metasearch engine].
- It provides basic privacy by mixing your queries with searches on other platforms without storing search data.  
- IndiCOM can be added to your browser's search bar; moreover, it can be set as the
default search engine.
